            <h2>Summary</h2>
            <p>The star-delta motor starter is a common method used to reduce the starting current of induction motors. In this system, the motor initially starts in the star configuration, where the windings are connected in series, reducing the voltage across each winding and thus limiting the starting current. Once the motor reaches a certain speed, it switches to the delta configuration, where the windings are connected in parallel, allowing the motor to operate at full voltage and power.</p>
            <p>Components of the starter include contactors, overload relays, and a control circuit. The application of the star-delta starter is prevalent in industries with large induction motors, such as manufacturing, mining, and agriculture, where high starting currents can cause voltage drops and damage electrical equipment. Benefits include reduced mechanical stress on the motor, minimized power disturbances, and improved efficiency.</p>
